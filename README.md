## Cyclistic Study Case
In this project, we are going to a study case that is incorporated with Data Analysis workflow. This project will dive into 5 data analysis processes stating the business requirement (Ask), gathering and ensuring the data credibility (Prepare), cleaning the data (Process), analyzing to gain insight (Analyze), and sharing our insight with the stakeholder by making a report (Share).
### 1. Ask, Prepare, Process.
For this process I'm using R as a programming language, using R I could prepare the data so it is clean, and transform it in a proper format for visualizing it using Tableau [Link]()
### 2. Analyze and Share
By using Tableau I could visualize the data, analyzing it, while also generating a report using some of the features. [Link]()
